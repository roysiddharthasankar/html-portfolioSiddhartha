    <h2>The Best Movies According to Siddhartha</h2>

    <p><strong>My Top Three Movies Of All Time</strong></p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    1. <strong>Shawshank Redemption</strong>
     <P>I realy like Andy Dufresne and I can relate to him. <br>He always tried to help others and create solutions to problems even though he was wrongfully charged to Prison. <br>This kept me to maintain a positive mentality all the time.</P>
     <p>2. <strong>Kimi No Na Wa</strong></p>
     <p>It has great storyline and each and evety frame is screenshot worthy, <br>and the characters were very wholesome. <br>It's a movie for hopeless romantics and this movie left me in tears even though I don't know the reason.  </p>
     <p>3. <strong>Rockstar</strong></p>
     This movie is very close to me. <br>It has the best character transition I've seen ever in my life.<br> The protagonist, Ranbir Kapoor is an excellent actor which he proved in this film. <br>I've seen this movie 5-6 times and continue to do so.
